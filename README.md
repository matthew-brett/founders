# TALMO example and exercise

## Now the workshop is over

Go to <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/matthew-brett/talmo/master?filepath=talmo.ipynb>.  Wait a little, and the notebook will appear, and you can interact with it.

The link above uses the public and free [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder)
project to run the notebook on a very cheap Google cloud computer.

## Instructions during the workshop

**These instructions will not work, because I have since shut down the server
that I set up for the workshop**.

This was the setup for the more likely practical situation, where you have
enough money to pay for more cloud resources, and you need start-up times to
be reasonably fast, and where you have considerable flexibility in
configuration.

To run this example in the session, you will have needed the following
password:

```
talmoworkshop
```

Armed with this password, you would have gone to this link
<https://hub.dynevor.org/user/matthew-brett/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmatthew-brett%2Ftalmo&subPath=talmo.ipynb>.

You might have seen a browser window like this:

You entered *your email address* as your username, and used the password above:
